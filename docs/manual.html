<h2>Studio Controls Manual</h2>
<p>
	Studio Controls is a response to the pitfalls people have encountered setting up
	audio on Linux for (semi)professional use. Many installers on Linux do not install
	JACK with correct system permissions. Being able to hear desktop audio is often
	desirable or needed while using JACK. USB microphones have become common. While
	it has always been possible to deal with these problems, it meant manually creating
	and running scripts at each JACK startup. It means learning the "gottchas" and restarting
	the whole thing just because a USB device was plugged in.
</p>
<p>
	Studio Controls expects pulseaudio to be configured for desktop use. Cadence in particular
	and possibly hand crafted pulseaudio configurations are likely to cause pulseaudio to fail
	to start when it should. Cadence deserves special mention because it writes pulseaudio
	configuration files to the user directory which means that even removing Cadence from the
	machine does not remove these files leaving the machine without a proper 
	working pulseaudio setup. In these cases it is perhaps better to continue using Cadence 
	than switching to Studio Controls.

<p>
Studio Controls has been divided into tabs in order to present the settings
in an easier to understand manner. This manual will use the same layout.

shots may look different on your machine.</em></p>
